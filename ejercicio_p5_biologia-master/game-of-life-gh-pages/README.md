# Conway's Game of Life

A JavaScript (using the p5.js library) implementation of Conway's cellular automaton, Game of Life, with visible finite grid, added rules for corners and borders and a drawing mode.

Run it: https://rodrigocucick.github.io/game-of-life/

Works best/only in Firefox (sorry for the inconvenience).
